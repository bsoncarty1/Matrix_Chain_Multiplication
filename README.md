  The purpose of this coding assignment is to implement a dynamic programming based solution to find the fastest way to multiply a chain of matrices. 
The input for this file is the 'data.txt' file found in this repository.
To run my implementation of this assignment, open up the command line and enter '$java FastMatrixMulti data.txt'
The output will consist of two things:
  1. The printed form of the best way to perform the multiplication of the given matrices.
  2. The actual minimum time cost of multiplying the given matrix chain.

  This assignment was assigned in the Algorithms class that I took at Eastern Washington University. As a student, matrices were a difficult subject for me. This is why I am displaying this assignment on GitHub. I am proud of the focus and grit that I gathered to complete this assignment. By doing so, I proved I can learn a difficult subject and translate it into code.
